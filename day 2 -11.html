    <p> As a comparison to our efforts towards the works to get success, we often expect much more and want success to knock our doors very soon.If in case, it does not happen, we use to get frustrated and finally get deeper inside the darkness of inferiority. Such a situation has been noticed among most of the people where regular and dedicated efforts have been ignored and merely the failures have been entertained. There stand several such examples all over the world. Most of the iconic personalities have previously faced serious failures in their lifeâ€™s struggles. Yet, they continued on their ways to success and finally achieved massive success in their fields of expertise. No caste, creed,<del> religion or colors stopped <br> </del>  ever <ins> in their ways towards success.</ins>
